# ðŸš€ Let's Go Further - Go JSON API

This project is a complete RESTful JSON API built in Go, based on the book **[Let's Go Further](https://lets-go-further.alexedwards.net/)** by Alex Edwards.

The book goes beyond the basics of Go and teaches advanced concepts by guiding you through building a real-world API project. This repository is the final result of that journey.
